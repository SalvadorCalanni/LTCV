Hi!

This repository corresponds to the following preprint:
Here, you can find the Looming Test with Contrast Variation (LTCV) code located in the LTCV folder. The first thing you are going to need is to set up your experimental arena. Please follow the instructions located in the notebook Setup_experimental_arena.ipynb, which is also situated in the LTCV folder.
Additionally, you can review the data analysis conducted in the paper (the GLM model) and explore our original data as an example in the "data analysis" folder.

The code and the original data were created at Laboratiorio de Neeruquímica Retiniana y Oftalmología Experimental (NROE), Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales (FCEN), Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA), Argentina.

Good luck!
